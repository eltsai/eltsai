🌱I'm Elisa. I am a ~~1st~~ ~~2nd~~ ~~3rd~~ ~~4th~~ final year (😱) Ph.D. student at CSE@umich, advised by Professor [Atul Prakash](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~aprakash/). My research focuses on building pragmatic, GenAI-powered systems for web security. I also design algorithms for efficient, high-quality training data selection for vision and large language models.
