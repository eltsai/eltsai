🌱I'm Elisa, a first year Ph.D. Student in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I'm advised by [Prof. Roya Ensafi](https://ensa.fi/) and part of the 🌎 [Censored Planet Lab](https://github.com/censoredplanetm). I'm interested in Internet measuring and privacy-related topics.



I still don't get it but it seems like some of my code is now [lying under ice layers in the Arctic](https://archiveprogram.github.com/). Humans are weird.



Oh and my avatar is Mr. Tangyuan, and he goes by Tang-Tang. 🐈Cats are weird too but in a good way. <!--Hopefully, this pandemic will be over soon so that I can meet my furry boy again.-->
